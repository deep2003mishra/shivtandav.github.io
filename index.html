<p>Lyrics and Meaning in english</p>
<p>Jatatavigalajjala pravahapavitasthale<br>
Galeavalambya lambitam bhujangatungamalikam<br>
Damad damad damaddama ninadavadamarvayam<br>
Chakara chandtandavam tanotu nah shivah shivam<br><br>

With his neck consecrated by the flow of water that flows from his hair,<br>
And on his neck a snake, which is hung like a garland,<br>
And the Damaru drum that emits the sound “Damat Damat Damat Damat”,<br>
Lord Shiva did the auspicious dance of Tandava. May he give prosperity to all of us.<br><br>

Jata kata hasambhrama bhramanilimpanirjhari<br>
Vilolavichivalarai virajamanamurdhani<br>
Dhagadhagadhagajjva lalalata pattapavake<br>
Kishora chandrashekhare ratih pratikshanam mama<br><br>

I have a deep interest in Shiva<br>
Whose head is glorified by the rows of moving waves of the celestial Ganga river,<br>
Which stir in the deep well of his hair in tangled locks.<br>
Who has the brilliant fire burning on the surface of his forehead,<br>
And who has the crescent moon as a jewel on his head.<br><br>

Dharadharendrana ndinivilasabandhubandhura<br>
Sphuradigantasantati pramodamanamanase<br>
Krupakatakshadhorani nirudhadurdharapadi<br>
Kvachidigambare manovinodametuvastuni<br><br>

May my mind seek happiness in Lord Shiva,<br>
In whose mind all the living beings of the glorious universe exist,<br>
Who is the companion of Parvati (daughter of the mountain king),<br>
Who controls unsurpassed adversity with his compassionate gaze, Which is all-pervading<br>
And who wears the Heavens as his raiment.<br><br>

Jata bhujan gapingala sphuratphanamaniprabha<br>
Kadambakunkuma dravapralipta digvadhumukhe<br>
Madandha sindhu rasphuratvagutariyamedure<br>
Mano vinodamadbhutam bibhartu bhutabhartari<br><br>

May I find wonderful pleasure in Lord Shiva, who is the advocate of all life,<br>
With his creeping snake with its reddish brown hood and the shine of its gem on it<br>
Spreading variegated colors on the beautiful faces of the Goddesses of the Directions,<br>
Which is covered by a shimmering shawl made from the skin of a huge, inebriated elephant.<br><br>

Sahasra lochana prabhritya sheshalekhashekhara<br><br>
Prasuna dhulidhorani vidhusaranghripithabhuh<br>
Bhujangaraja malaya nibaddhajatajutaka<br>
Shriyai chiraya jayatam chakora bandhushekharah<br><br>

May Lord Shiva give us prosperity,<br>
Who has the Moon as a crown,<br>
Whose hair is bound by the red snake-<br>
Whose footrest is darkened by the flow of dust from flowers<br>
Which fall from the heads of all the gods – Indra, Vishnu and others.<br><br>

Lalata chatvarajvaladhanajnjayasphulingabha<br>
nipitapajnchasayakam namannilimpanayakam<br>
Sudha mayukha lekhaya virajamanashekharam<br>
Maha kapali sampade shirojatalamastunah<br><br>

May we obtain the riches of the Siddhis from the tangled strands Shiva’s hair,<br>
Who devoured the God of Love with the sparks of the fire that burns on his forehead,<br>
Which is revered by all the heavenly leaders,<br>
Which is beautiful with a crescent moon.<br><br>

Karala bhala pattikadhagaddhagaddhagajjvala<br>
Ddhanajnjaya hutikruta prachandapajnchasayake<br>
Dharadharendra nandini kuchagrachitrapatraka<br>
Prakalpanaikashilpini trilochane ratirmama<br><br>

My interest is in Lord Shiva, who has three eyes,<br>
Who offered the powerful God of Love to fire.<br>
The terrible surface of his forehead burns with the sound “Dhagad, Dhagad …”<br>
He is the only artist expert in tracing decorative lines<br>
on the tips of the breasts of Parvati, the daughter of the mountain king.<br><br>

navina megha mandali niruddhadurdharasphurat<br>
Kuhu nishithinitamah prabandhabaddhakandharah<br>
nilimpanirjhari dharastanotu krutti <br>
Kalanidhanabandhurah shriyam jagaddhurandharah<br><br>

May Lord Shiva give us prosperity,<br>
The one who bears the weight of this universe,<br>
Who is enchanting with the moon,<br>
Who has the celestial river Ganga<br>
Whose neck is dark as midnight on a new moon night, covered in layers of clouds.<br><br>

Praphulla nila pankaja prapajnchakalimchatha<br>
Vdambi kanthakandali raruchi prabaddhakandharam<br>
Smarachchidam purachchhidam bhavachchidam makhachchidam<br>
Gajachchidandhakachidam tamamtakachchidam bhaje<br><br>

I pray to Lord Shiva, whose neck is bound with the brightness of the temples<br>
hanging with the glory of fully bloomed blue lotus flowers,<br>
Which look like the blackness of the universe.<br>
Who is the slayer of Manmatha, who destroyed the Tripura,<br>
Who destroyed the bonds of worldly life, who destroyed the sacrifice,<br>
Who destroyed the demon Andhaka, who is the destroyer of the elephants,<br>
And who has overwhelmed the God of death, Yama.<br><br>

Akharvagarvasarvamangala kalakadambamajnjari<br>
Rasapravaha madhuri vijrumbhana madhuvratam<br>
Smarantakam purantakam bhavantakam makhantakam<br>
Gajantakandhakantakam tamantakantakam bhaje<br><br>

I pray to Lord Siva, who has bees flying all around because of the sweet<br>
Scent of honey coming from the beautiful bouquet of auspicious Kadamba flowers,<br>
Who is the slayer of Manmatha, who destroyed the Tripura,<br>
Who destroyed the bonds of worldly life, who destroyed the sacrifice,<br>
Who destroyed the demon Andhaka, who is the destroyer of the elephants,<br>
And who has overwhelmed the God of death, Yama.<br><br>

Jayatvadabhravibhrama bhramadbhujangamasafur<br>
Dhigdhigdhi nirgamatkarala bhaal havyavat<br>
Dhimiddhimiddhimidhva nanmrudangatungamangala<br>
Dhvanikramapravartita prachanda tandavah shivah<br><br>

Shiva, whose dance of Tandava is in tune with the series of loud<br>
sounds of drum making the sound “Dhimid Dhimid”,<br>
Who has fire on his great forehead, the fire that is spreading out because of the<br>
breath of the snake, wandering in whirling motions in the glorious sky.<br><br>

Drushadvichitratalpayor bhujanga mauktikasrajor<br>
Garishtharatnaloshthayoh suhrudvipakshapakshayoh<br>
Trushnaravindachakshushoh prajamahimahendrayoh<br>
Sama pravartayanmanah kada sadashivam bhaje<br><br>

When will I be able to worship Lord Sadashiva, the eternally auspicious God,<br>
With equanimous vision towards people or emperors,<br>
Towards a blade of grass and a lotus, towards friends and enemies,<br>
Towards the most precious gem and a lump of dirt,<br>
Toward a snake or a garland and towards the varied forms of the world?<br><br>

Kada nilimpanirjhari nikujnjakotare vasanh<br>
Vimuktadurmatih sada shirah sthamajnjalim vahanh<br>
Vimuktalolalochano lalamabhalalagnakah<br>
Shiveti mantramuchcharan sada sukhi bhavamyaham<br><br>

When I can be happy, living in a cave near the celestial river Ganga,<br>
Bringing my hands clasped on my head all the time,<br>
With my impure thoughts washed away, uttering the mantra of Shiva,<br>
Devoted to the God with a glorious forehead and with vibrant eyes?<br><br>

Imam hi nityameva muktamuttamottamam stavam<br>
Pathansmaran bruvannaro vishuddhimeti santatam<br>
Hare gurau subhaktimashu yati nanyatha gatim<br>
Vimohanam hi dehinam sushankarasya chintanam<br><br>

Anyone who reads, remembers and recites this stotra as stated here<br>
Is purified forever and obtains devotion in the great Guru Shiva.<br>
For this devotion, there is no other way or refuge.<br>
Just the mere thought of Shiva removes the delusion.<br><br></p>
